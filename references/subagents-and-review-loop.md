# Subagents And Review Loop

Use this file before delegating work or running audits.

## When To Use Subagents

Use subagents when work can be separated without losing the main argument:

- coverage audit across a large requirement list
- source discovery for distinct regions, companies, periods, or source types
- evidence-chain verification
- counterargument search
- reader-quality review after the draft is factually stable
- style cleanup on a bounded section

Do not use subagents to avoid doing the main synthesis. The main agent owns the thesis, structure, and final judgment.

## Useful Subagent Roles

### Requirement Mapper

Turns user requirements into a checklist with completion status and missing items.

### Source And Evidence Auditor

Checks whether important claims are supported, whether sources were actually accessed, and whether inaccessible sources were treated honestly.

### Coverage Auditor

Checks whether required companies, actors, regions, time periods, source categories, or themes are covered.

### Skeptical Reviewer

Finds hype, PR laundering, weak causal claims, overgeneralization, and missing counter-cases.

### Structure Reviewer

Checks whether the report has a clear thesis, section logic, non-duplicative flow, and an actual synthesis.

### Reader Critic

Runs only after factual and coverage audits. It evaluates readability, cognitive load, continuity, friction points, and research-report feel. It must not introduce new facts.

## Subagent Prompt Requirements

Each prompt should include:

- objective
- exact files or sections to inspect
- output format
- what counts as PASS or FAIL
- what the subagent must not do
- requirement to distinguish facts, source claims, interpretations, and suggestions

Avoid leaking the intended answer unless the task is pure compliance checking.

## Prompt Templates

Use these as compact starting points. Replace bracketed fields before delegation.

### Requirement Mapper

```text
You are a requirement mapper for a longform research task.

Read:
- [task_spec path or user requirement file]
- [progress file, if any]

Your job:
1. Extract all mandatory requirements.
2. Group them by coverage, sources, analysis, writing, review, and final output.
3. Mark each item as DONE / PARTIAL / MISSING / NOT YET CHECKABLE.
4. List the next concrete actions for PARTIAL or MISSING items.

Output:
- PASS / FAIL
- Requirement table
- Missing items
- Next actions

Do not rewrite the report. Do not add new requirements.
```

### Evidence Auditor

```text
You are an evidence auditor for a bounded research section.

Read:
- [draft section path]
- [source_registry path]
- [claims_registry path]
- [uncertainty_registry path, if any]

Your job:
1. Check whether each important hard claim has traceable support.
2. Identify claims that confuse fact, source claim, interpretation, and author judgment.
3. Identify missing counter-evidence or uncertainty boundaries.
4. Actively look for issues. If you find none, explain the evidence supporting PASS.

Output:
- PASS / FAIL
- Unsupported or weak claims
- Source/claim mismatches
- Required revisions

Do not add new facts. Do not change the thesis.
```

### Coverage Auditor

```text
You are a coverage auditor for a longform research task.

Read:
- [task_spec path]
- [progress path]
- [draft or section paths]

Your job:
1. Compare required coverage against completed units.
2. Mark each required company, product, region, period, source type, or theme as COVERED / PARTIAL / MISSING.
3. For PARTIAL or MISSING items, state the gap and the minimal fix.
4. Actively look for omissions. If everything passes, explain why.

Output:
- PASS / FAIL
- Coverage table
- Gaps
- Minimal fixes

Do not rewrite sections. Do not expand the project scope.
```

### Reader Critic

```text
You are a reader critic for a completed or near-completed research draft.

Read:
- [draft path]
- [scope note or task_spec path]

Your job:
1. Evaluate reading flow, cognitive load, argument continuity, and research-report feel.
2. Identify confusing, repetitive, overcompressed, or process-like passages.
3. Suggest expression, ordering, transition, and density fixes only.

Output:
- Reading Flow: Weak / Acceptable / Strong
- Cognitive Load: Heavy / Manageable / Light
- Argument Continuity: Weak / Acceptable / Strong
- Research Report Quality: Weak / Acceptable / Strong
- Smooth sections
- Friction points
- Reader-focused revisions

Do not fact-check. Do not introduce new facts. Do not reopen source collection.
```

## Common Failure Modes

- Subagent pretends to verify sources it did not access.
- Subagent rewrites the main thesis instead of auditing the assigned scope.
- Subagent adds new requirements not requested by the user.
- Subagent summarizes instead of checking.
- Subagent marks PASS without listing evidence.
- Multiple agents edit the same file concurrently.

Mitigation:

- Give bounded inputs and bounded outputs.
- Ask for missing evidence and concrete revision actions.
- Require PASS/FAIL plus reasons.
- Route findings through the main agent before editing.
- Keep concurrent agents read-only unless the workflow explicitly supports separate output files.

## Review Loop

Use this loop after each major section and before final delivery:

1. Run the appropriate review role. Preserve its original findings.
2. Check each finding against the task, the current passage, and the relevant evidence. A detail missing from a supplied source summary is not proof that the original source lacks support; check the source before changing a supported claim.
3. Batch corrections for confirmed defects, including factual imprecision, required omissions, and analysis or reader problems that violate the agreed requirements. Record a reasoned no-change decision for unsupported allegations, duplicate observations, and optional preferences.
4. Record the disposition and its evidence or changed location in `logs/review.jsonl`. A no-change decision cannot waive unfinished required work.
5. Re-run affected review dimensions and any task-required current-version reviews. Stop when the agreed quality requirements are met and no confirmed defect remains; do not seek empty finding lists or add optional changes just to satisfy every reviewer.

Do not treat an audit report as the final deliverable. The audit exists to improve the article.

## Reader-Driven Revision

Trigger reader review after:

- data collection is complete enough for the current draft
- evidence and coverage audits have passed or remaining limitations are explicit
- an initial full draft exists

The Reader Critic rates:

- Reading Flow: Weak / Acceptable / Strong
- Cognitive Load: Heavy / Manageable / Light
- Argument Continuity: Weak / Acceptable / Strong
- Research Report Quality: Weak / Acceptable / Strong

Use numeric scores only when the user explicitly asks for scoring.

Allowed revisions:

- section order
- transitions
- paragraph density
- titles
- redundant explanations
- process-language cleanup
- clarity and rhythm

Disallowed revisions:

- inventing new facts
- changing evidence boundaries
- reopening source collection unless a separate evidence audit requires it
- replacing the author's thesis without explanation

Cap reader-driven revision at three cycles unless the user asks for more.
